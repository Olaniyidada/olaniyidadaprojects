									<p>Black Gold retail store wants to design an end-to-end business intelligence solution from scratch. The company wants to track KPI on sales, profit, 
										and profit margin, compare regional performance, analyze product level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value clients. The company provided 
										a folder of raw CSV files containing information about transactions, products, customers, and territories. The dataset was extracted, uploaded, and 
										transformed using Power BI analytical tools. Dimension tables were developed and connected to sales facts tables in the model view. DAX was deployed 
										for calculations and two separate visualizations were built to analyze the company’s sales performance and demography. KPIs of total sales, total profit, 
										total orders, and profit margin coupled with bookmark buttons were built and added to the dashboard. The clustered bar charts were used to analyze sales 
										by category, top 10 products, and sales by region, and the line chart visualized the sales trend. The company management gets valued insights from the 
										end-to-end business intelligence solution developed.</p>

									<p>In the realm of commerce, Vancouver engages in the retail of a diverse range of products, encompassing furnishings, home appliances, and office supplies, catering to 
									a wide array of households. It is imperative to delve into the intricacies of the company's operations using SQL, a proficient tool that allows access, manipulate, 
									and extract the requisite data essential for analytical pursuits. SQL query was applied to track the entire table, the product column, the total quantity of products ordered,
									and the average price of products in each category, the most ordered product in each city, the total quantity for each product ordered in New York, the top 5 products with a 
									quantity of more than 100, transactions that occurred between 2015-01-16 to 2015-01-20, identifying the product with the highest average price, finding out the total revenue 
									made from the sales of product in each state, showing the days orders were made, listing cities with  letter “e”, and classifying the Revenue (< 100 – Small Income, 
									100 – 199 Mid Income, 200 – 299 High Income, 300 > Mighty Income.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tech Haven Electronics.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Tech Haven Electronics started as a small electronics store in a local shopping mall but has since expanded to three locations across the city, offering a range of electronic 
									products and services. Over the years, the company has built a reputation for excellent customer service and competitive pricing. To thrive in the rapidly changing market, adapt 
									to shifting consumer preferences, embrace e-commerce, and focus on sustainability, the Tech Haven database was manipulated, analyzed, and schemas were modified to create a new 
									database for the company. The following tasks were performed in SQL analysis: creation of the Tech Haven database, creation of dataset tables for sales, customers, and products, 
									and population of each dataset table. Questions concerning client details and their purchasing patterns were addressed, and answers were provided to the probing questions of Tech 
									Haven management.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Atlantic Bank<br />
										Business Requirements Document [BRD]</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Atlantic Bank Picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Atlantic Bank offers limited banking services on weekdays (8 hours per day). The bank does not provide enough service hours for customers 
									as it is not open in the evenings or on weekends. Moreover, when a customer calls the contact center, it takes at least 20 minutes to speak 
									to an agent, which results in a poor customer service experience. Each phone call made by a customer costs the bank $3 per hour, representing 
									a significant expense for the business. The current business problem was identified, and online banking was proposed as the solution. This would 
									allow customers to log in to their accounts and manage them 24/7. This solution would also significantly reduce call center volume and help decrease 
									the expenses associated with running a call center. Online banking capabilities were added to the customer-facing website: atlanticbankofamerica.com.
									The customer's physical location may impact their ability to access certain products, services, or features, which were noted as assumptions/dependencies. 
									The Business Requirements (Modules) template was drafted for business review and approval.</p>
